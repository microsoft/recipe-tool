# ðŸ“„ Document Generator App

A Gradio web interface for creating structured documents using AI-powered generation. Define document outlines with resources and sections, then generate complete documents using the recipe executor.

## Features

- **Visual Outline Editor**: Create document structures with nested sections (up to 4 levels)
- **Resource Management**: Upload text files or reference URLs as source materials
  - Supports text-based files: Markdown, JSON, source code, CSV, etc.
  - Does not support binary files: Word docs, PDFs, PowerPoint, images
- **Two Generation Modes**:
  - **Prompt Mode**: AI generates content based on prompts and resource references
  - **Static Mode**: Directly include content from resources
- **Live JSON Preview**: See your outline structure in real-time with validation
- **Import/Export**: Upload existing docpacks or download your work as docpack files
- **Azure OpenAI Support**: Configurable for both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI via environment variables

## Quick Start

### Development Mode

```bash
# From workspace root
make install               # Install dependencies
document-generator-v1-app     # Launch the web interface
```

### Deployment Mode

```bash
# Build self-contained deployment package
make build                 # Bundle recipes + refresh examples

# Then deploy the entire app directory
# The app will automatically use bundled recipes
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:8000`

## Configuration

### LLM Provider Configuration

The app supports both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI:

```bash
# For OpenAI (default)
export LLM_PROVIDER=openai
export DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-4o

# For Azure OpenAI
export LLM_PROVIDER=azure
export DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-4o
export AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com
export AZURE_USE_MANAGED_IDENTITY=true
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-managed-identity-client-id

# Or with API key instead of managed identity
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

See [Azure Deployment Guide](AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

## How to Use

1. **Add Resources**: Click "+ Add" under Resources to add source files or URLs

   - Set a unique key for each resource
   - Upload text files (Markdown, JSON, source code, etc.) or provide URLs
   - Add descriptions to help the AI understand the content

2. **Create Sections**: Click "+ Add" under Sections to build your document structure

   - Use "+ Sub" to create nested subsections
   - Choose between Prompt mode (AI generation) or Static mode (direct inclusion)
   - Reference resources in your prompts using their keys

3. **Generate Document**: Once your outline validates (green Generate button), click to create your document

   - The AI will process each section according to your instructions
   - Download the generated Markdown file when complete

4. **Reset When Needed**: Click "Reset Outline" to clear everything and start fresh

5. **Save Your Work**: Use "Download Docpack" to save your outline and resources as a portable .docpack file

## Example Outline

```json
{
  "title": "Project README",
  "general_instruction": "Create a comprehensive README for the project",
  "resources": [
    {
      "key": "code_files",
      "path": "./src",
      "description": "Source code files"
    }
  ],
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Overview",
      "prompt": "Write a brief project overview based on the code structure",
      "refs": ["code_files"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Building for Deployment

The app can be built into a self-contained deployment package that includes all recipe files and refreshed examples.

### Build Command

```bash
# From the document-generator directory
make build

# Or run the script directly:
python scripts/build_deployment.py
```

### What the Build Process Does

1. **Bundles Recipe Files**: Copies all recipe files from `/recipes/document_generator/` into `document_generator_app/recipes/`
2. **Refreshes Examples**: Updates example docpacks with latest content and bundled resources
3. **Updates .gitignore**: Adds bundled recipes to ignore list (since they're generated)
4. **Verifies Build**: Ensures all required files are present and correctly bundled

### Deployment vs Development

- **Development Mode**: App uses recipes from the main repository (`/recipes/document_generator/`)
- **Deployment Mode**: App uses bundled recipes (`document_generator_app/recipes/`)
- **Automatic Detection**: The app automatically detects which mode to use based on file presence

After building, the entire `apps/document-generator/` directory becomes self-contained and can be deployed independently without the rest of the repository.

## Refreshing Example Docpacks (Development)

For development work, you can refresh just the examples without doing a full build:

```bash
# From the document-generator directory
make refresh-examples

# Or run the script directly:
python scripts/refresh_examples.py
```

### Example Sources

- **Source files**: `/recipes/document_generator/examples/*.json`
- **Resource files**: `/recipes/document_generator/examples/resources/`
- **Generated docpacks**: `apps/document-generator/examples/*.docpack`

The source JSON files contain full file paths to actual resource files. When converted to docpacks, the referenced files are bundled inside the .docpack archive, creating fully functional examples.

Built with Gradio for the UI and uses the recipe-executor for document generation.
